# ETF Bubble Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes ETF data with bubble charts showing the relationship between flows and AUM.

## Key Features

- **Optimized LLM Integration**: The chat functionality now uses context-aware messaging to minimize token usage. Data is sent to the LLM only when needed (first question or context refresh), rather than with every question.
- **Interactive Bubble Charts**: Visualize ETF data with customizable filters
- **Smart Data Filtering**: Chat queries automatically parse ETF tickers, categories, and subcategories to provide relevant responses

## Project Structure

- `bubble_dashboard.py`: The main Streamlit app that generates the dashboard.
- `llm_api.py`: Contains LLM integration with both legacy and optimized context-aware functions.
- `aum.csv`: CSV file containing AUM data.
- `fund flow.csv`: CSV file containing fund flow data.
- `funds.csv`: CSV file with additional fund information.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of required packages:
  - pandas
  - plotly
  - streamlit

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository** and open it in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Install the required dependencies** by running:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the App

Start the application using Streamlit by running:

```sh
streamlit run bubble_dashboard.py
```

This will open the ETF Bubble Chart Dashboard in your default web browser.

## How It Works

1. The dashboard loads data from the CSV files using the `load_data` function.
2. Users can filter ETFs by category and secondary category.
3. The bubble chart is generated using Plotly based on user-selected filters:
   - **Label Options:** Choose between labels under the bubble or a side legend.
4. The chart displays key metrics like **TTM Net Flow**, **Monthly Flow**, and **AUM** for each ETF.
5. **Chat Functionality**: Ask questions about the data using the sidebar chat. The system optimizes token usage by:
   - Sending data context only on the first question
   - Using conversation history for follow-up questions
   - Providing a refresh button to reset context when needed

## LLM Optimization Features

The chat system includes several optimizations to reduce token usage:

- **Context-Aware Messaging**: Data is sent only when needed, not with every question
- **Smart Entity Parsing**: Automatically identifies relevant ETF tickers, categories, and subcategories from questions
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple questions in the same session
- **Manual Context Refresh**: Users can refresh data context using the ðŸ”„ button

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and functionality by editing `bubble_dashboard.py`. The file contains inline comments to help guide customization related to:
- Data loading
- Filtering logic
- Chart appearance using Plotly section [`px.scatter`](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).

## Data Sources

Data is sourced from Bloomberg. The dashboard is built with Streamlit & Plotly and was created in 2025.
